                <h2>Who is Cluster Buster?</h2>
                <p>
                    The name Cluster Buster was conjured from a whiskey-fueled creative music session.
                    In 2013 the first album <a href="https://future80s.bandcamp.com/album/they-call-her-one-eye" title="The album">They Call Her One eye</a> was released, inspired
                    by a Swedish thriller going by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_%E2%80%93_A_Cruel_Picture" title="wikipedia on the thriller">same name.</a>
                    Throughout the existence of Cluster Buster, many different side projects have worked as a way to avoid losing inspiration and to keep the name fresh.
                    <a href="https://stevensilverheart.bandcamp.com/album/in-the-night">Steven Silverheart</a> is one example of these <i>side</i> projects. Often these <i>aliases</i>
                    are very thematically different.
                    While the Cluster Buster theme is often dark, referencing old 80s horror flicks, the alias <a href="https://future80s.bandcamp.com/album/orbitalo">Orbitalo</a>
                    has a <i>space italo</i> kind of sound, while Steven Silverheart's project focuses on <i>feelgood</i> <nobr>italo dance.</nobr>

                <h2>The Music</h2>
                <p>
                    <img src="media/total.jpg" width="400" style="float:right; width:30%;" alt="total terror, cover art">
                    Cluster Buster's music is mostly based on the horror synth and dark synth sub-genres. It is meant to give a sense of
                    immersion and is often used as background music for action packed horror scenes. The music is driven by a synthesizer,
                    backed up closely by drums and bass for the beat, and uses unique sound samples to add depth to the music. The sound
                    samples can vary from the sound of shotgun shells falling to zombie growls and violins. When listening to Cluster
                    Buster’s music one could imagine being in a heartpounding chase scene in a horror movie, or in a terrifying anxiety
                    riddled eventuality, and the music only adds more atmosphere to the situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like most electronic based music, Cluster Buster's music starts out simplistic and low in intensity. Gradually
                    throughout the song it increases in intensity and complexity by introducing more instruments and unique sounds to
                    compliment the existing rhythm and feel. There is rarely any vocals in the songs, for the few exceptions the vocals are
                    used as sounds to enhance the song itself. The songs start out with 1 or 2 instruments or synthesized sounds. At even
                    intervals a new instrument is introduced to the song. The beginning is often bass or drums to set the rhythm then
                    followed by a synthesizer for the lead melody. Further into the song unique sounds are sometimes added to create
                    diversity and break repetition, like a growling zombie.
                </p>
                <h3>Artwork</h3>
                <p>
                    <img src="media/kneedeep.jpg" width="400" style="float:right; width: 25%;" alt="knee deep, cover art">
                    The artwork for his songs compliment the music by portraying a scene. They are very illustrative based on the name and
                    atmosphere of the song, for example the song "Sexploitation". The song has an image of an undressed woman with a sultry
                    glance. As the name of the song implies, she is ready to exploit someone, sexually. The images' feel is then enchanted with the music playing in the
                    background. Another example would be for the song "High Incident Bandits" with an illustration of a man with a shotgun,
                    portaiting him as a bandit out to do mischief. The song connected to the illustration creates a vibe of underground
                    crime, which enhances the sense unlawfulness in the picture.

                <h2>What is retrowave?</h2>
                <p>Retrowave is a genre of electronic music that emerged in the 2000s. The genre mimics the musical style of the
                    electronic <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-beginners-guide-to-the-synth-1736978695">synthesizer</a> music that
                    originated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The visual artwork of retrowave, or the <em>aesthetic</em>, is
                    considered to be almost as important as the music itself.
                    Retrowave romanticizes the nostalgia of movie- and video game soundtracks from the 1980s,
                    especially genres like action, science fiction, horror and slasher movies.
                </p>
                
                <p>Retrowave music can be divided into subgenres like outrun, vaporwave, dreamwave, retro electro, italo disco,
                    darksynth, and others.
                    Musically, all the genres normally use characteristics from the 1980s like straight 4/4 beats, exaggeratedly loud
                    drum samples, and <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gated_reverb">gated reverbs</a>. The main rhythm, pads, and
                    melodies are created using synthesizers (or plugins that mimic the sound of a synthesizer). Synthwave isn’t
                    necessarily instrumental, but a majority of the music is without vocals, with synths performing the lead
                    melodies instead. Many artists also interpret more modern genres through retrowave, for example retrowave fused
                    with modern metal music, like <a href="https://carpenterbrut.bandcamp.com/">Carpenter Brut</a>
                    and <a href="https://dancewiththedead.bandcamp.com/">Dance With the Dead</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="media/WhereverWhenever.jpg" width="400" style="float:left; width: 25%;" alt="cover art, wherever whenever by steven silverheart" title="Palmtree and sunset themed cover">
                    A prime example of the most common recurring theme of the retrowave aesthetic is the image of a coastal city during
                    sunset, with palm trees in the background,
                    reminiscent of a warm summer day. This is dreamwave. <a href="https://vhsdreamsofficial.bandcamp.com/">VHS Dreams</a>
                    is an artist that expresses their music using these visuals.
                </p>
                <p>Then you have the outrun aesthetic, which usually features 1980s sports cars driving in the night, in a futuristic
                    city filled with neon lights. <a href="https://kavinsky.bandcamp.com/">Kavinsky</a>
                    is a good example of outrun music, especially the song "Nightcall".
                    Darksynth takes inspiration from slasher and horror movies like Day of the Dead, Friday the 13th, The Evil Dead,
                    specifically the "movie poster" type pictures of these films;
                    the artwork for <a href="https://future80s.bandcamp.com/album/midnight-maimer">Cluster Buster</a> consist of images
                    like these. Contrasting to the gloomy and sinister atmosphere of darksynth, there are
                    italo disco or retro electro artists like <a href="https://mirkohirsch.bandcamp.com/">Mirko Hirsch</a> and <a href="https://future80s.bandcamp.com/album/ozone-surfing">Damokles</a>.
                </p>
                <p>The movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780504/">Drive </a> from 2011 brought retrowave to the mainstream
                    with the main title theme "Nightcall" by Kavinsky gaining massive attention on the internet, through media
                    channels like Spotify and YouTube. The series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/">Stranger Things</a>
                    from 2016 embraces the 80s nostalgia, and also boosted the popularity of the genre, by having its soundtrack being
                    exclusively electronic music similar to retrowave.
